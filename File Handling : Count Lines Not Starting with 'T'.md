# File Handling in Python: Count the Frequency of Each Character in a File

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that reads a text file and calculates the frequency of each character present in the file.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Start
2. Prompt the user to enter the file name or path.
3. Open the file in read mode.
4. Initialize an empty dictionary to store character frequencies.
5. Read the content of the file character by character.
6. For each character:
7. If it is already in the dictionary, increment its count.
8. Otherwise, add it to the dictionary with count 1.
9. Close the file.
10. Display the character frequencies.
11. End



## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
from collections import defaultdict
def create_file(file_path, content):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(content)

def char_frequency(file_path):
    fr=defaultdict(int)
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        text=file.read()
        for i in text:
            fr[i]+=1
    return fr
```

## Output

## Result
Thus,the Python program that reads a text file and calculates the frequency of each character present in the file is created successfully.
